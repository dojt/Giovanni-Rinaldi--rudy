# Giovanni Rinaldi's `rudy`
### Giovanni Rinaldi's random weighted graph generator "rudy"

I'm uploading here the source code of the graph generator "rudy" by Italian combinatorial optimization professor *Giovanni Rinaldi* ([this one](https://dblp.org/pid/07/2141.html) and [this one](https://euro2016.euro-online.org/index.html%3Fp=805.html)). The reason is that the files don't seem to be available in a 21st centurty format ‚Äî only hosted on professional homepages which will probably be shut down when the persons involved retire.

The files are:

- `rudy.c` ‚Äî Giovanni's code with edits by [Christoph Helmberg](https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~helmberg/)
- `gb_lib.c` ‚Äî This seems to be part of Donald Knuth's [Stanford GraphBase](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb.html). It seems that people usually include it when they share `rudy.c`.

This software was made before licenses were invented... or so it seems. I haven't seen conditions for sharing anywhere, here's my best guess.
1. Knuth writes on his web site: "Public-domain sources for all programs and data of The Stanford GraphBase are freely available." I'm not actually sure whether that means that he puts the source in the public domain. Some of his works are licensed under GPL, so be careful with this.
2. `rudy.c` ‚Äî the file notes the edits by Helmberg but says nothing about the original ownership. The "law of the land" seems to be to share it with in a CC-BY kind of way. Whether this means that it is acually open source software in today's meaning of the word (i.e., anything like MIT, Apache, GPL, CC-0, ...) I cannot say.
3. I just hope I won't get into trouble by making it available here... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
